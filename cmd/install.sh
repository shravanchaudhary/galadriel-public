# Run as: sudo bash cmd/install.sh

# Before running:
#   1. Edit cmd/galadriel.service — update the three path lines
#      (WorkingDirectory, ExecStart, EnvironmentFile) to match
#      where you cloned the repo and where your venv lives.
#   2. Make sure .env exists at the path you set in EnvironmentFile.
