# Galadriel

**A self-hosted Claude agent that remembers everything it has ever done — and rewrites its own code to get better at doing it.**

![Galadriel](assets/galadriel_promo.png)

> *"He inferred that persons who would train this faculty must select places, and
> form mental images of the things they wish to remember, and store those images
> in the places."*
> — Cicero, *De Oratore* II.lxxxvi, recounting Simonides of Ceos (c. 500 BCE)

The **method of loci** — the *memory palace* — is roughly twenty-five centuries old.
Simonides, the story goes, identified the dead crushed beneath a collapsed banquet
hall by recalling exactly where each guest had been seated, and from that inferred
that memory is strongest when bound to ordered *place*. Cicero wrote it down; orators,
scholars and modern memory champions have used it ever since. The name is not a
metaphor borrowed from a film — it is the oldest mnemonic architecture we have.

This project gives that architecture to a Claude agent, then connects it to something
new: **the ability to edit her own harness.** Those two facts, together, are the whole
idea.

## 🌟 The thesis: memory + self-modification = an agent that compounds

Most AI agents are amnesiac and frozen. Each session starts cold, and the code that
runs them never changes unless a human edits it. Galadriel is built to break both
limits at once, and the combination is the point:

| Capability | What it gives her | On its own |
|---|---|---|
| **🏛️ Verbatim memory palace** | Every decision, bug, cost figure and conversation, searchable by *meaning*, at **zero API cost** | A diary that never forgets |
| **🔧 Self-modification** | A full mandate to edit her own harness, scheduler, tools and identity files | A risky toy |
| **🔁 The two combined** | She remembers *what she tried, why it failed, and what she changed* — then restarts herself and continues | **An agent that learns from its own history and acts on it** |

A self-editing agent with no memory just repeats its mistakes faster. A perfect memory
with no ability to act on it is a library nobody visits. Put them together and you get
the thing this repo is actually about: an agent that notices a gap in how it works,
**writes the fix into its own code, restarts itself, and remembers why** — closing the
loop without a human in it.

The pieces that make this real, all already shipped:

- **A memory palace** built on the independent [**MemPalace**](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace)
  library — local, verbatim, semantically searchable, with a temporal knowledge graph.
  Retrieval costs **zero Anthropic tokens** (see [the memory section](#-significant-change--112-persistent-verbatim-memory-at-zero-api-cost)).
- **A one-shot wake** that survives a process restart — so she can restart *herself*
  to load new code and resume exactly where she left off, even across a crash
  (see [One-shot wake](#one-shot-wake--resuming-yourself-across-a-restart)).
- **Ambient reflection** — a silent, scheduled "thinking" loop that curates her own
  memory between conversations, recording what a reactive agent would forget
  (see [Ambient cognition](#ambient-cognition--the-agent-that-thinks-between-conversations)).
- **Self-modification discipline** baked into her identity — the
  [Karpathy coding principles](#baked-in-engineering-discipline-the-karpathy-principles)
  keep her self-edits surgical instead of sprawling.

*Build it and they will come* is a poor engineering plan, so here is the honest version:
the loop is **early**. She can already remember, restart herself, reflect silently, and
edit her own harness under a human's eye. The trajectory — from human-approved self-edits
toward genuinely autonomous, salience-driven self-improvement — is mapped in the
[Scheduler](#scheduler) and [Release Notes](#release-notes) sections. This README tells
you exactly where reality ends and ambition begins.

## 🚀 Easiest start: Docker (one command)

No Python, no virtualenv, no dependency wrangling. If you have Docker, you have a
running agent in two steps. New to Docker? Start with Docker's own short guides —
[Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and the
[Docker Compose overview](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) — then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avasol/galadriel-public.git
cd galadriel-public
cp .env.example .env          # open .env, paste your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
docker compose up -d --build  # builds the image and starts the agent
docker compose logs -f        # watch her wake up
```

That's the whole install. The image bundles everything the memory palace needs
(ChromaDB + embeddings), state persists on volumes, and the Tower web UI comes up on
[http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080). Add a `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` to `.env` and
she'll also greet you over Discord. Full details, first-boot palace seeding, and a
security note are in [Run with Docker](#run-with-docker). Prefer a local Python install
instead? See [Quick Start](#quick-start).

> **Where to get an API key:** the [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/).
> A `claude-opus-4-8` run is the default; downgrade to Sonnet or Haiku in `.env` for a
> cheaper agent — the [cost section](#the-cost-savings-that-most-people-miss) explains
> how prompt caching keeps even Opus affordable.

## 🟢 SIGNIFICANT CHANGE — 1.12: Persistent verbatim memory, at zero API cost

Galadriel just grew a memory palace. Not a vector-DB-as-a-service. Not a paid tier. A local, embedded, verbatim store of everything she has ever written — searchable by meaning, not just keywords — with **zero Anthropic tokens spent on retrieval**.

The integration is built on [**MemPalace**](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace), an independent local-first memory library. MemPalace does the real work (storage, embeddings, knowledge graph, temporal reasoning, compression). This harness adds the wrappers that expose it to the agent as **10 new tools** (14 total, up from 4) and wires it into the lifecycle — conversations are archived before `/new` clears them, daily logs are mined at goodnight, and a compact wake-up snapshot rides in the dynamic block so she walks into every session with her own continuity.

**Why this is the headline change:**

| Problem before | Solution now |
|---|---|
| Verbatim history was lost at `/new` or compaction | Everything is archived to the palace before it's cleared |
| Recall of facts older than today meant grepping daily logs | Semantic search across every config, log, and archived conversation |
| "What did we decide about X?" drained API budget (big context re-reads) | **Zero tokens** — all retrieval runs locally in ChromaDB + SQLite |
| No structured facts — everything was prose | Knowledge graph with temporal triples: `subject --[predicate]--> object`, with validity windows |
| No sense of self across sessions | Diary in her own voice; L0 wake-up snapshot injected into every turn |

**Measured impact (14 consecutive API calls on a deployed instance):**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Cache hit ratio (post-integration) | **86.5%** |
| Total-input token savings vs. no caching | **71.2%** |
| Palace lookup cost per search | **0 tokens** — ChromaDB query runs locally |
| Palace lookup cost for a 5-hop KG timeline | **0 tokens** — SQLite traversal runs locally |
| Estimated annual overhead of the integration | **~$95/year** (additional) |
| Drawers indexed on a real deployment | **706** across 7 rooms + 8 halls |
| Tools added | **10** (palace_search, palace_add_drawer, palace_wake_up, palace_taxonomy, palace_kg_add/query/invalidate/timeline, palace_diary_write/read) |

The 90% cache-read discount remains intact. Adding MemPalace costs ~1.5 percentage points of cache hit ratio (10 extra tool schemas in the tools-layer cache + a ~800-token wake-up snapshot in the dynamic block) and the rest is measured, bounded, and dial-backable (`PALACE_WAKE_UP_INJECT=0`).

**What this means in practice:**

- **Short term (within a session):** The agent can pull back a verbatim quote from a conversation three weeks ago — no re-reading of logs, no "I don't have that context." One tool call, zero tokens, the exact words you said.
- **Long term (across months):** The knowledge graph preserves history. When a fact changes, the old triple gets a `valid_to` date and the new one goes in — so "what was the max_tokens setting last October?" and "what is it now?" both resolve correctly. Nothing is overwritten, only superseded.
- **On relational questions:** Graph traversal ("everything ever said about the payment service," "every decision involving the scheduler," "the full timeline of the Polly voice choice") resolves as **one KG call against the local SQLite store**. The kind of query that, done naively through conversation history, would cost you real money — or just fail outright because the context has long since been compacted away.

Read on for [the metaphor system](#the-memory-palace-metaphor) (wings, rooms, drawers, halls) and the [caching details](#the-cost-savings-that-most-people-miss) that make this affordable in the first place.

---

## The memory palace metaphor

MemPalace organizes memory the way a human would organize a library, and the agent uses exactly the same words.

| Metaphor | What it is | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Drawer** | A single chunk of content — the atomic unit. ~200–1000 tokens, a verbatim slice of something the agent (or you) wrote. | One paragraph of a daily log. One decision note. One archived Discord exchange. |
| **Room** | A folder-based grouping of drawers. Every drawer belongs to exactly one room. | `room=memory` (daily logs), `room=harness` (her own code), `room=tower` (the web UI), `room=discord_bot`, `room=cmd`, `room=configuration`, `room=general`. |
| **Wing** | The top-level namespace. Usually one per agent. | `wing=agent` is the default. |
| **Hall** | A **keyword-based, auto-classified topic** that cross-cuts rooms. A drawer about a bug in harness code lives in `room=harness` AND `hall=problems`. | `hall=decisions`, `hall=problems`, `hall=milestones`. |

Why this matters: **rooms** let you say *"look only in the code area"*, **halls** let you say *"look only at things tagged as problems"*, and you can compose both. A search like `palace_search("retry logic", room="harness", hall="problems", k=10)` reads as "give me bug-tagged content from the code room" — which is exactly how a human would ask a librarian.

The agent's **diary** is a separate wing — her own journal, written at end-of-session, read at wake-up. Her own voice to her future self, not mixed with operational logs.

The **knowledge graph** sits alongside the drawers. Where drawers are prose, the KG is relational: `claude-opus-4-6 --[supports]--> prompt_caching` with `valid_from=2025-07-10`. When a fact changes you don't delete the old triple, you invalidate it. History is preserved; the timeline is queryable.

**The library is [MemPalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace).** All credit for the storage layer, the embedding pipeline, the knowledge graph, the AAAK compression dialect, and the wake-up generation belongs to the MemPalace team. This harness is a consumer — it adds the Python wrappers, the tool schemas, and the lifecycle hooks (archive-before-clear, mine-at-goodnight, inject-at-wake-up) that expose the library to a running Claude agent.

### First-time setup

```bash
# 1. Install (mempalace is in requirements.txt)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Copy the room layout template
cp mempalace.yaml.example mempalace.yaml

# 3. Initialize palace storage (defaults to ~/.mempalace/)
mempalace init

# 4. Seed the palace with everything you've got
mempalace mine .
```

That's it. The harness picks it up automatically on next start. `palace_search` works immediately; the wake-up snapshot appears in the next API call.

### Env vars (all optional)

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MEMPALACE_PATH` | `~/.mempalace/palace` | Where the palace lives on disk. Read by MemPalace itself. |
| `PALACE_ARCHIVE_ROOT` | `~/.mempalace/archive` | Where archived conversations + pre-compaction tool_results land before being mined. |
| `PALACE_WAKE_UP_FILE` | `~/.mempalace/wake_up.md` | Cached wake-up snapshot. |
| `PALACE_WAKE_UP_INJECT` | `1` | Set to `0` to disable the wake-up injection into the dynamic block (recovers a small amount of per-call token overhead if budget is tight). |

## The cost savings that most people miss

Here is a fact that most Claude API users don't know about: **cached tokens cost 90% less than regular input tokens.** Not 10% less. Not 20% less. Ninety percent. [It's in the Anthropic docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching), but the majority of people building with the API leave this entirely on the table.

The math is brutal in your favour. Every API call you make, Claude processes your system prompt from scratch — your personality definition, your memory files, your tool schemas — and you pay full price for every token, every time. With prompt caching, after the first call, all of that context reads at **$0.30/MTok instead of $3/MTok** (on Sonnet). That's the same intelligence, the same context, for a tenth of the cost. On a long-running personal agent with a rich system prompt, this is not a rounding error. It changes the economics entirely.

Galadriel exploits this with three cache breakpoints, stacked deliberately:

| Cache layer | What it covers | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| **Tool definitions** | All 14 tool schemas (4 core + 10 palace) | Cached once at startup, never re-sent |
| **Stable system block** | Personality + memory + identity files | Marked `cache_control: ephemeral`; hits at ~100% after first call |
| **Trailing message history** | The growing conversation | Attached per-call; cache hit rate rises every turn |

The stable block alone — your SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, identity files — is typically 4 000–8 000 tokens. On a warm cache, those tokens cost $0.08–$0.30/MTok instead of $0.80–$3.00/MTok depending on model. That's your biggest fixed overhead per call, cut by 90%, on every single turn of the conversation.

Anthropic's own benchmarks show latency dropping by up to 85% on long prompts with caching engaged. A 100K-token context that took 11.5 seconds drops to 2.4 seconds. For a persistent agent that carries memory across sessions, this is the difference between a tool that feels alive and one that grinds.

**Compaction** finishes the job. The `/compact` command uses Claude Haiku — the cheapest model in the family — to summarize old tool results in your conversation history. A 60-message session bloated with verbose shell output compresses to 20% of its token count, for a fraction of a cent. Haiku handles the summarization; Opus handles the thinking.

Use `/status` in Discord at any time to watch live token numbers — input, cache_read, cache_write, output — for the last API call.

### ⚠️ One thing you must do to activate the savings

Prompt caching has a **minimum prefix length** before it engages. If your stable block is too short, the API silently skips caching entirely — you get no error, no warning, just a `cache_read=0` in every log line and a bill that looks exactly like the naive approach.

| Model | Minimum to activate caching |
|---|---|
| Claude Opus 4.8 (the default) · Sonnet 4.6 · Sonnet 4.5 | **1,024 tokens** (~4 KB of text) |
| Claude Opus 4.6 · Opus 4.5 · Haiku 4.5 | **4,096 tokens** (~16 KB) |
| Claude Opus 4.7 | **2,048 tokens** |

*(Source: [Anthropic prompt-caching docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) — minimum cacheable prompt length. Verify against the live table for your exact model.)*

Out of the box, `config/SOUL.md` + `config/MEMORY.md` together are roughly 500–800 tokens. **That is below every threshold above** — including the 1,024-token floor for the default `claude-opus-4-8`. Caching will not engage until you cross it.

**The fix:** fill in `config/CONTEXT.md`. Drop your project's architecture, goals, key file paths, known quirks, and current status into it. Any `*.md` file you place in `config/` is automatically loaded into the stable cache block — so adding content there is all it takes. A reasonably filled CONTEXT.md (1–2 pages of project notes) pushes the total well past the 1,024-token floor for the default Opus 4.8 — and past 4,096 too, which covers the older Opus 4.6 / 4.5 and Haiku 4.5 if you downgrade.

Once you're over the threshold, verify it's working:

```bash
journalctl -u galadriel -f   # or check your terminal output
```

Look for lines like:
```
Tokens | input=60 cache_read=5800 cache_write=0 output=240
```

`cache_read` climbing and `cache_write` near zero after the first call = caching is engaged and you're paying 10 cents on the dollar for that context. If `cache_read` stays at 0, add more content to `config/CONTEXT.md`. See `CACHING.md` for the full breakdown and a worked cost example.

> **Sonnet 4.6 / 4.5 users:** your floor is only 1,024 tokens — the same as the default Opus 4.8 — so a modestly filled SOUL.md + MEMORY.md + CONTEXT.md crosses it easily. Filling CONTEXT.md is worthwhile regardless: the agent gets your project context without spending tool calls to find it.

## Baked-in engineering discipline: the Karpathy principles

This project's `CLAUDE.md` embeds the [Andrej Karpathy coding guidelines](https://github.com/multica-ai/andrej-karpathy-skills/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) — four principles distilled from Karpathy's observations on how LLMs fail as coding assistants when left to their own instincts.

Karpathy's insight is that LLMs have a systematic failure mode: they over-build. Given any instruction, they add abstraction layers that weren't asked for, refactor adjacent code that wasn't broken, invent "flexibility" that will never be used, and generate 200 lines when 40 would suffice. The guidelines are a direct antidote to that tendency:

**1. Think Before Coding** — State assumptions explicitly. If multiple interpretations exist, surface them — don't pick silently. If something is unclear, stop and ask rather than confidently building the wrong thing.

**2. Simplicity First** — Minimum code that solves the problem, nothing speculative. No unrequested features. No abstractions for single-use code. No error handling for impossible scenarios. If it could be 50 lines, make it 50 lines.

**3. Surgical Changes** — Touch only what the task requires. Don't improve adjacent code. Don't refactor things that aren't broken. Match existing style. When your changes make something obsolete, remove it — but leave pre-existing dead code alone.

**4. Goal-Driven Execution** — Transform vague tasks into verifiable goals. "Fix the bug" becomes "write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass." Clear success criteria let the agent loop independently to completion rather than guessing when it's done.

These aren't abstract ideals — they are mechanically enforced via the `CLAUDE.md` file that Claude Code (and Galadriel, when asked to modify her own harness) reads before every task. The result is fewer rewrites, smaller diffs, and changes that trace directly to what was asked. For a codebase that runs as a persistent service you actually depend on, this matters.

## Features

- **Discord gateway** — DMs, channel mentions, or a dedicated channel; gated by user ID
- **Web UI (Tower)** — local chat interface and dashboard at `localhost:8080`
- **Tool use** — 14 tools: shell execution, file read/write, memory logging, and 10 [MemPalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace) tools (semantic search, knowledge graph, diary, taxonomy); all async, non-blocking
- **Persistent verbatim memory** — local MemPalace integration with wings/rooms/halls/drawers, zero-token retrieval, archive-before-clear on `/new`, goodnight mine of daily logs, wake-up snapshot in the dynamic block
- **Safety tiers** — green (auto), yellow (notify), red (Discord reaction approval required)
- **Scheduler** — morning briefing, goodnight, configurable heartbeat (with custom task-monitor prompts), a restart-surviving **one-shot wake**, and **ambient reflection** (silent palace-only thinking on a workday cadence)
- **Job watcher** — monitors `/tmp/galadriel-jobs/*.done` markers and reports completions
- **Compaction** — Haiku-powered context compression on demand (archives verbatim tool_results to the palace before summarizing)
- **Three-layer prompt caching** — automatically managed, always active

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/avasol/galadriel-public.git
cd galadriel-public

# 2. Install (includes mempalace — dependency of the memory palace)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY at minimum

# 4. (Optional but recommended) Seed the memory palace
cp mempalace.yaml.example mempalace.yaml
mempalace init              # creates ~/.mempalace/
mempalace mine .            # indexes this repo into the palace

# 5. Run
python main.py
```

**Tower-only mode:** Omit `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` — the harness runs with just the web UI on port 8080.

**Full mode:** Set both `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`.

**Skipping step 4?** That's fine — the harness runs normally and palace tools just return `[palace unavailable]` until you seed. You can do it any time.

---

## Run with Docker

The fastest path to a running warden — no local Python, no venv. A two-stage
image bundles everything (including the ChromaDB/onnxruntime stack the memory
palace needs).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avasol/galadriel-public.git
cd galadriel-public
cp .env.example .env          # set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY at minimum
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

**First boot — seed the palace once** (otherwise `palace_*` tools report
`[palace unavailable]` until there's something to search):

```bash
docker compose exec galadriel mempalace init
docker compose exec galadriel mempalace mine .   # optional: index the repo
```

### What persists

State lives on volumes, not inside the image, so `docker compose down` won't
forget anything:

| Mount | Holds |
|---|---|
| `palace` (named volume → `/data`) | The memory palace + conversation archive (`~/.mempalace`) |
| `./memory` | Daily memory logs (markdown — also visible on your host) |
| `./config` | `scheduler_state.json`, `ambient_state.json`, `active_vision.txt` |

### Notes

- **The Tower UI has no authentication.** The compose file binds it to
  `127.0.0.1:8080` deliberately. Do **not** expose it on `0.0.0.0` on a public
  host without an authenticated reverse proxy or SSH tunnel in front.
- **Image size is ~1.3 GB** — onnxruntime (a transitive dependency of the
  memory palace) is the bulk. That's the cost of zero-API-cost semantic recall.
- **Multi-arch:** `python:3.12-slim` is published for amd64 and arm64, so a
  plain `docker build` works on both. For a registry image covering both:
  `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t <repo> --push .`
- **Tower-only mode:** omit `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in `.env` to run just the web UI.

## Customization

### She ships ready

`config/SOUL.md` contains Galadriel's complete identity — the Cyber-Elf persona, her values, her voice, her continuity instructions. This is not a placeholder. Clone the repo, set your API key, and she's alive. You don't need to touch SOUL.md to get started.

When you're ready to make her your own: edit the name, rewrite the vibe, change the metaphors. The harness is fully persona-agnostic — SOUL.md is just a Markdown file. Some people have replaced her entirely with a stoic Roman general, a dry British detective, a no-nonsense SRE. It works because the character lives in the file, not in the code.

### MEMORY.md — tell her who you are and where she lives

`config/MEMORY.md` is her operational memory: your name, your infrastructure, your constraints. The agent can update it herself during a session using the `write_file` tool. Here's what a real deployment looks like:

```markdown
## About Your User
- User Name: Lord Isildur          ← what she calls you, every message
- Authorized Discord ID: 123456789012345678

## Infrastructure
- Server: EC2 t4g.medium, eu-north-1
- Working Dir: /opt/galadriel
- Python Venv: /home/ubuntu/.venv
- Model: claude-opus-4-6

## Operational Notes
- AWS_PROFILE must be blank when using instance role
- Git remote: https://github.com/you/galadriel-public.git
```

Fill in your real values and she'll orient herself correctly from the first message of every session.

### CONTEXT.md — your project, always in context

`config/CONTEXT.md` is where you describe what you're building. It loads into the stable cache block alongside SOUL.md and MEMORY.md, so Galadriel always has your project's architecture, goals, and known quirks available without needing tool calls to find them. It's also what pushes the stable block over the Opus cache minimum — see the warning above.

## Discord Commands

### Slash commands (native Discord UI — type `/` to see them)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new` | Archive conversation to the palace, then start fresh |
| `/compact` | Compress history with Haiku (archives verbatim tool_results to the palace first) — reports token reduction |
| `/status` | Model, memory usage, last API token breakdown, scheduler state |

### Prefix commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!status` | Same as `/status` |
| `!clear` | Archive to palace, then clear history for this channel |
| `!new` | Same as `!clear` — archive then fresh start |
| `!compact` | Compress history (with palace archive of long tool_results) |

### Verbal

| Input | Behaviour |
|-------|----------|
| `rest` / `rest.` / `rest!` | Disable heartbeat; agent acknowledges |

---

## Safety Tiers

All shell commands are classified before the agent executes them:

| Tier | Behaviour | Examples |
|------|----------|---------|
| 🟢 **Green** | Auto-execute | `ls`, `git status`, `aws s3 ls`, `cat`, `python3 script.py` |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | Notify, proceed | `git push`, `pip install`, `sudo systemctl`, `sam deploy` |
| 🔴 **Red** | Discord reaction required (✅/❌, 30s timeout → denied) | `rm`, IAM changes, CloudFormation mutations, `shutdown` |

Unknown commands default to yellow. Red commands denied by timeout or ❌ are never executed.

---

## Scheduler

| Event | Default time | Condition |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Morning briefing** | 09:10 CET | Workdays (Mon–Fri) |
| **Ambient reflection** | 11:00 / 14:00 / 17:00 / 20:00 CET | Workdays; **silent** — palace-only, no Discord output |
| **Goodnight** | 21:00 CET | Daily; disables heartbeat |
| **Heartbeat** | Every 5/10/20/30 min | When enabled; off by default; can carry a custom monitoring prompt |
| **One-shot wake** | Once, ASAP | When armed; **survives a process restart**; clears itself after firing |

### The heartbeat as a task monitor

The heartbeat isn't just a check-in. Enable it with a **custom prompt** and it
becomes a self-monitoring loop for a long-running background job — the agent
wakes every N minutes, runs the prompt (e.g. "tail the narration log, report
progress, and disable yourself when it's done"), and reports to Discord. This is
how the agent watches over anything it launches that outlives a single turn.

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/scheduler/heartbeat \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"enabled": true, "interval": 20, "prompt": "[SYSTEM:HEARTBEAT:MONITOR] ..."}'
```

### One-shot wake — resuming yourself across a restart

A persistent agent that can edit its own harness eventually needs to **restart
itself and keep going**. The one-shot wake is the mechanism: arm a single
self-prompt, and it fires exactly once on the next scheduler loop — *or*, if the
process restarts in between, on the next boot. It is persisted to
`scheduler_state.json` and cleared only **after** its message is delivered, so a
crash mid-flight re-arms it rather than losing it. A wake is never silently lost.

```bash
# Arm a wake (fires once, ~8s after the next start)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/scheduler/wake \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt": "[SYSTEM:WAKE] Resume the task you restarted for. Recover context from your diary + palace, finish, then sign off."}'

# Disarm
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/scheduler/wake \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"disarm": true}'
```

Unlike the heartbeat, the wake is **independent of heartbeat state** — it is the
correct tool for "resume me after I restart myself," and it does not spam: it
fires once and goes quiet.

### Ambient cognition — the agent that thinks between conversations

Most agents are purely reactive: they exist only inside a request/response turn,
and the moment between conversations is dead air. **Ambient reflection** gives
the agent a heartbeat of *private thought* instead.

At a workday cadence (11:00, 14:00, 17:00, 20:00 CET by default), the scheduler
fires a **silent** reflection turn. The agent is prompted to take stock — *What
is the state of the work? What did I notice that I haven't recorded? Is there an
open question worth keeping, a pattern worth naming, a fact that has changed?* —
and to **file anything worth keeping to the memory palace** (a drawer, a
knowledge-graph fact, a diary entry).

The crucial design choice: **this output never reaches Discord.** It is routed
through `_send_agent_silent`, which runs the turn purely for its side effects.
The user sees nothing. The value isn't a message — it's *continuity of
attention*. The agent walks into the next real conversation having already
noticed and recorded what mattered, rather than reconstructing it cold.

**Why this matters (the long-term plan, such as it is):** a memory palace is
only as good as what gets written into it, and the most valuable observations —
the texture of a live exchange, a pattern in how the user works, an unresolved
thread — are exactly the ones a reactive agent forgets to record because it's
busy answering. Ambient reflection closes that gap. It is the first step toward
an agent whose memory is *curated by itself, continuously*, not just dumped at
goodnight. The intended trajectory:

1. **Now:** silent palace filing on a fixed cadence — recording what would
   otherwise be lost between turns.
2. **Next:** reflection that reads its own recent diary + open-questions and
   *threads* across ticks, so a thought begun at 11:00 can be picked up at 14:00
   rather than starting fresh each time.
3. **Later:** the agent deciding *when* it has something worth reflecting on,
   rather than firing on a fixed clock — reflection triggered by salience, not
   schedule.

It is opt-out for a reason: each tick is a real (if cheap, cached) API call. If
your model tier is expensive or you simply don't want background turns, disable
it with `GALADRIEL_REFLECTION=0`. The harness is fully functional without it —
ambient cognition is an enhancement, not a dependency.

## Security Notes

**Before running on a public server, read this.**

**Tower UI has no authentication.** It's designed to run on `127.0.0.1` and be accessed via SSH tunnel. Binding it to `0.0.0.0` on a server with an open port gives anyone who can reach that port full agent access — which includes shell execution.

> Access Tower over SSH tunnel: `ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 user@host` — keep `TOWER_HOST=127.0.0.1`.

**Discord is the secure interface.** Authorization is enforced by `DISCORD_AUTHORIZED_USER_ID`. Only messages from that user ID are processed. Unauthorized users get "I do not know you, stranger."

**`run_shell` is unrestricted.** The agent can execute any command the process user can run. The safety tier system classifies and gates commands, but it's defense-in-depth, not a sandbox. Run the harness as a low-privilege user on a dedicated machine or VM.

**`read_file` and `write_file` have no path restrictions.** The agent can read any file the process can access. This is intentional for a personal assistant that needs to operate freely on your system.

**Debug prompt dumps** are excluded from git (`.gitignore` covers `debug/prompts/`). If you re-enable them, be aware they contain your full system prompt including personality and memory files.

## Release Notes

### 1.15 — README: the thesis, front and centre

A documentation release. The README now leads with what the project is actually
*about* — a memory palace **plus** self-modification, and what their combination
makes possible — rather than burying that under a cost pitch. Concretely: a new
Simonides/Cicero provenance epigraph (the *memory palace* is a 2,500-year-old
technique, not a coined phrase); a "🌟 The thesis" section stating the
memory + self-modification loop explicitly and honestly marking where reality
ends and ambition begins; and a "🚀 Easiest start: Docker" section promoted to
the top with beginner links (Docker Desktop, Compose, Anthropic Console) so a
newcomer can reach a running agent in two commands. No code changed.

### 1.14 — Ready-to-run Docker image

A two-stage `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml`. `cp .env.example .env &&
docker compose up -d --build` and you have a warden — no local Python, no venv.
The builder stage compiles the ChromaDB/onnxruntime wheels the memory palace
needs; the runtime is `python:3.12-slim` running as a non-root `galadriel` user
with state on named volumes (`~/.mempalace`, `./memory`, `./config`), so
`docker compose down` forgets nothing. Tower binds to `127.0.0.1:8080` only by
default. Multi-arch (amd64 + arm64). See [Run with Docker](#run-with-docker).

### 1.13 — Self-direction: one-shot wake, ambient cognition, custom heartbeats

Three capabilities that move the agent from purely reactive toward
self-directed, all landing in `harness/scheduler.py` + the Tower API.

1. **One-shot wake (`pending_wake`).** A single, restart-surviving self-prompt.
   `Scheduler.arm_wake(prompt)` persists it to `scheduler_state.json`; it fires
   exactly once (~8 s after the next scheduler start) and clears itself **only
   after** delivery — so a process that arms a wake and then restarts (including
   one that restarts *itself*) still honours it on the next boot. A crash
   mid-delivery re-arms rather than loses. Exposed at `POST /api/scheduler/wake`.
   This is the mechanism that lets a self-modifying agent restart and resume.

2. **Ambient reflection.** A silent, workday-cadence "thinking" loop
   (`_reflection_loop` → `_reflection_routine`, fired at 11/14/17/20 CET). The
   agent takes stock and files anything worth keeping to the palace — but the
   turn is routed through a new `_send_agent_silent`, so **nothing reaches
   Discord**. The value is continuity of attention: observations that a reactive
   agent forgets to record get captured between conversations. Opt-out via
   `GALADRIEL_REFLECTION=0`. See the [Scheduler](#scheduler) section for the
   design intent and roadmap.

3. **Custom heartbeat prompts.** `set_heartbeat()` now accepts a `prompt`
   argument (persisted as `heartbeat_prompt`), and `POST /api/scheduler/heartbeat`
   passes it through (accepts `prompt` or `heartbeat_prompt`). This turns the
   heartbeat into a task monitor — the agent can watch a long-running background
   job, report each tick, and disable itself when the job completes.

Also in 1.13: default model bumped to **`claude-opus-4-8`** (1M-token context),
with explicit downgrade guidance in `.env.example` for cost-sensitive
deployments (Sonnet / Haiku). `palace_add_drawer` gained an optional `room`
argument for routing drawers into the relational layer. All changes are
additive and degrade gracefully — the wake/reflection loops silently no-op if
MemPalace isn't installed, and ambient cognition is fully optional.

### 1.12.1 — max_tokens recovery hardening

A silent dataloss path was identified and closed. Previously, if an agent response ran over the `max_tokens` ceiling three times in a row, the harness trimmed the conversation twice (dropping messages from the front) and then hard-reset it — **without** archiving the dropped content to the palace. The archive-before-clear contract established in 1.12 for `/new` and `/compact` didn't extend to this recovery path. A runaway output cascade could eat an entire channel's verbatim history.

Four changes in `harness/agent.py` and one in `config/SOUL.md` close this:

1. **Archive-before-recovery.** At the first `max_tokens` retry, before any trim or reset fires, the current message list is snapshotted and queued via `asyncio.create_task(palace.archive_conversation(...))` with a channel tag of `max_tokens_<channel_id>`. One archive per cascade covers both subsequent trims and a possible hard reset. Fire-and-forget — recovery is never blocked by the mine.

2. **Output-ceiling early warning.** A new `_maybe_warn_output_ceiling` fires the existing `context_warning_callback` when two consecutive responses come within 100 tokens of `max_tokens`. Gives the user a chance to `/compact` or steer toward brevity *before* the third strike starts the cascade. Silent no-op if no callback is wired up. Streak resets on any response that comes in comfortably below the ceiling.

3. **Post-recovery advisory.** When a cascade archives + trims/resets, the archive tag is recorded per-channel. On every subsequent `respond()` call in that channel (until it's genuinely cleared via `/new`), a `[SYSTEM:POST-RECOVERY-ADVISORY]` block is appended to the system prompt telling the model the archive tag so it can `palace_search` if the user references missing history. The reset message itself also advertises that the prior exchange was preserved in the palace.

4. **Concision principle in `SOUL.md`.** A new *"Favour the scalpel"* line in the Vibe section soft-caps runaway prose at the persona level. "A 2000-token response almost always hides a 400-token answer." Lead with the answer, stop when it's said.

All changes are additive and gracefully degrade. If MemPalace isn't installed, the archive step silently no-ops (the trim/reset still happens so the conversation can continue). If the `context_warning_callback` isn't wired up, the output-ceiling warning is silent. The harness still works without any of the Palace integration.

### 1.12 — MemPalace integration: persistent verbatim memory at zero API cost

**10 new tools, 14 total.** The agent now has a local semantic memory palace ([MemPalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace)) wired into the harness as first-class tools: `palace_search`, `palace_add_drawer`, `palace_wake_up`, `palace_taxonomy`, `palace_kg_add / kg_query / kg_invalidate / kg_timeline`, `palace_diary_write / diary_read`. All retrieval runs locally in ChromaDB + SQLite — **zero Anthropic tokens spent on any palace operation**, including multi-hop knowledge-graph traversals that would otherwise cost real money through conversation history.

**Lifecycle hooks.** `/new`, `!new`, and `!clear` now archive the conversation to the palace *before* clearing it (via a new `GaladrielAgent.pop_and_archive_history()`), so nothing is lost at the moment of wipe. Goodnight (21:00 CET) fires `palace.archive_daily_logs()` so today's log becomes searchable overnight. `/compact` and context compaction file verbatim tool_results to the palace before they're replaced with Haiku summaries.

**Wake-up injection.** A compact L0+L1 snapshot (~800 tokens, cached to `~/.mempalace/wake_up.md` by a subprocess that keeps chromadb out of the main process) rides in the dynamic system-prompt block on every API call. Disable with `PALACE_WAKE_UP_INJECT=0` if you want to dial back per-call overhead.

**Cache impact, measured.** 14 consecutive calls on a real deployment: 86.5% cache hit ratio, 71.2% total-input token savings vs. no caching. The 90% cache-read discount is intact — integration costs ~1.5 percentage points of cache hit ratio (one extra wake-up snapshot in dynamic, 10 more tool schemas in the tools-layer cache). Estimated annual overhead: ~$95.

**Graceful degradation.** If MemPalace isn't installed, all palace tools return `[palace unavailable]` at dispatch time; the rest of the harness runs normally. Upgrade path is `pip install mempalace>=3.3.2,<3.4` + `mempalace init` + `mempalace mine .`.

**Palace Protocol** codified in `SOUL.md` — 5 non-negotiable rules: verify before speaking, say "let me check" when unsure, diary at session-end, invalidate-then-add when facts change. See `config/TOOLS.md` for the full decision matrix (memory_log vs palace_add_drawer vs palace_kg_add vs palace_diary_write).

All credit for the underlying memory system goes to the [MemPalace](https://github.com/MemPalace/mempalace) team. This release is the harness integration; MemPalace is the engine.

### 1.11 — approval UX cleanup

**Buttons replace reactions.** Red-tier command approvals now render as Discord UI buttons (`discord.ui.View`) instead of ✅/❌ reactions. The "1/1" counter artifact from the bot's own seed reactions is gone, buttons disable on click to prevent double-submits, and the resolved message shows a proper greyed-out state. Also noticeably better on mobile — tap targets beat emoji-picker fiddling.

**Dedup concurrent approvals.** When Claude re-emits the same `run_shell` tool_use (typically after a `max_tokens` retry), subsequent callers now attach to the in-flight Future instead of spawning a second bubble. One bubble, one click, every caller gets the same answer. Fixes the "⏰ Timed out (denied)" message that could appear for a command which had already been approved and executed successfully. The resolved bubble also annotates dedup hits — `(merged 2 requests)` etc — so it's visible when the path fires.

### 1.1 — image handling & error ergonomics

**iOS screenshot support.** Discord's `content_type` header is unreliable on iOS — screenshots arrive labelled `image/jpeg` even when the bytes are PNG. Anthropic's API validates the actual format and returned a 400, breaking image upload on mobile. The harness now sniffs magic bytes (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP) and uses the real type. Discord's header is treated as a hint, not truth.

**Image retention by user turn.** `/compact` strips image blocks from any message older than the last 3 user turns, independent of total message count. Previously images only aged out once they fell behind the "last 20 messages" cutoff, which could span many turns when tool use was involved. Three exchanges in, the base64 blob is usually moot — stop paying to carry it.

**Humanized API errors.** Instead of dumping raw exception repr to Discord (`Error code: 400 — {'type': 'error', ...}`), common Anthropic API exceptions are now mapped to short, readable explanations: timeouts, rate limits, auth failures, overloaded 529s, bad-request details, model-not-found hints. Unknown errors still fall through unchanged. Server logs continue to capture the full traceback for forensics.
